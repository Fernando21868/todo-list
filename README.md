# Overview

This project is a fully functional **To-Do List Application** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to enhance my understanding of JavaScript syntax and features such as event listeners, DOM manipulation, localStorage integration, recursion, Native Array ES6 functions, use a JavaScript library written by someone else, handling exceptions, Display output to the screen. The application demonstrates practical skills in web development, focusing on creating an interactive and responsive user interface.

The purpose of writing this software was to deepen my understanding of front-end development while implementing best practices like modular code, recursive functions, and external libraries (Lodash). This project also served as a platform to experiment with clean UI/UX design principles and optimize functionality for task management.
